# Project3E
The scientific question for this project is: If mice and humans have different Per2 gene protein sequences, will this affect the expression of the Per2 gene in different tissues? The hypothesis states: If there is a difference in the protein sequence of the Per2 gene between mice and humans, then the Per2 gene will be expressed differently in tissues. 
To run the code:
  -Jupyter Notebook 
  -FASTA files for Per2 in mice, human and cattle 
The FASTA files can be found on NCBI database by searching Per2. Under the tab that says 'Genes' there is a 'Gene' tab. By clicking that, it will take you to all the Per2 genes found in different organisms. The first two searches were for the Per2 gene found in Mus musculus (house mouse) and Homo sapiens (humans).
