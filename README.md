# Project3E
The scientific question for this project is: If mice and humans have different Per2 gene protein sequences, will this affect the expression of the Per2 gene in different tissues? The hypothesis states: If there is a difference in the protein sequence of the Per2 gene between mice and humans, then the Per2 gene will be expressed differently in tissues.
